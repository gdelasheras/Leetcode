"""
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: â€œThe lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as 
the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).

T: O(h)
S: O(1)

where:
    - h is the height of the tree
